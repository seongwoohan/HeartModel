This folder contains the python version of matlab code in https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin/ModSimPrograms/ch1/. It contains (1) in_circ.py, (2) circ.py, (3) sa.py, and (4) LV_sa.py. For the ipython notebook version, circ.ipynb contains all functions and values in in_circ.py.

(1) in_circ.py contains functions and values needed to run circ.py. (2) circ.py is the main program for the whole circulation simulation. (3) sa.py loops over time and computes the simulation of systemic arteries. (4) LV_sa.py is a simulation of the left heart and the systemic arteries.
