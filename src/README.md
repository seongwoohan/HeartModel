This folder contains software to perform numerical simulation for each intervention in the heart. 

The surgical treatment is to create connections that do not normally exist in the circulation after birth, but that allow blood partially to bypass the lungs. 
The connections are creating a hole in the (1) atrium, (2) ventricle, or (3) connecting the main pulmonary artery with the aorta. 
Three proposed treatments create a condition that would normally be considered a disease state. 
That state, in case (1) is called ”atrial septal defect”, in case (2) it is called ”ventricular septal defect”, and in
case (3) it is called ”patent ductus arteriosus”. 
In all cases, the goal is to only create a right-to-left shunt to allow some blood to bypass the lung, which helps to lower the pulmonary artery pressure.


(1) circ_asd.m: connection between atrium
(2) circ_vsd.m: connection between ventricle
(3) circ_d.m: connection between the main pulmonary artery with the aorta
