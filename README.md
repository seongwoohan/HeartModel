# Introduction

We provide computer models, optimizing three proposed surgical treatments of refractory pulmonary hypertension. 
The models set up the methodology to examine the treatment results without actually performing the surgery. 
Numerical simulations are performed to compare the change of pressure and oxygen saturation in pulmonary artery and systemic artery to examine the impact of the treatments.

This software is build upon https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin/ModSimPrograms/ch1/. 
See here for original code of computer simulation in heart and circulation.

# Experiment

Run the below files to see the numerical simulation in each intervention:

1. circ_asd.m 
2. circ_vsd.m 
3. circ_d.m 

There is a new python version for the model. Run the below files as well to see the numerical simulation in each intervention:

1. circ_asd.py
2. circ_vsd.py
3. circ.d.py
